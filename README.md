This is a project I created to analyze my best friend and I's Discord conversation history over the past 6 years. 


I downloaded my best friend and I's entire Discord conversation history using. I used pandas to clean my data and find trends, matplotlib to visualize trends, NTLK to tokenize and preprocess text, and scikit-learn (K-Means, TF-idf) to get started with clustering similar messages.
