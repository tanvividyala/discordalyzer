# Discord Analyzer Tool

This is a project I created to analyze my best friend and I's Discord conversation history over the past 6 years. I used pandas to clean my data and find trends, matplotlib to visualize trends, NTLK to tokenize and preprocess text, and scikit-learn (K-Means, TF-idf) to get started with clustering similar messages. 

Some features I've finished are: visualization of messages sent over time, visualization of trends in the use of words or phrases by each person and overall, visualization of proportion of messages sent by each person, and word clouds for the most frequently said words in a period of time. I've also started features to provide day summaries which I will update once I get more OpenAI tokens (GPT4All crashes my computer) and a tool that'll cluster series of messages with similar themes.
